module Graphics.UI.Gtk.Abstract.Container (
-- * Detail
--
-- | A Gtk+ user interface is constructed by nesting widgets inside widgets.
-- Container widgets are the inner nodes in the resulting tree of widgets: they
-- contain other widgets. So, for example, you might have a 'Window' containing
-- a 'Frame' containing a 'Label'. If you wanted an image instead of a textual
-- label inside the frame, you might replace the 'Label' widget with a 'Image'
-- widget.
--
-- There are two major kinds of container widgets in Gtk+. Both are
-- subclasses of the abstract 'Container' base class.
--
-- The first type of container widget has a single child widget and derives
-- from 'Bin'. These containers are decorators, which add some kind of
-- functionality to the child. For example, a 'Button' makes its child into a
-- clickable button; a 'Frame' draws a frame around its child and a 'Window'
-- places its child widget inside a top-level window.
--
-- The second type of container can have more than one child; its purpose is
-- to manage layout. This means that these containers assign sizes and
-- positions to their children. For example, a 'HBox' arranges its children in
-- a horizontal row, and a 'Table' arranges the widgets it contains in a
-- two-dimensional grid.
--
-- To fulfill its task, a layout container must negotiate the size
-- requirements with its parent and its children. This negotiation is carried
-- out in two phases, size requisition and size allocation.

-- ** Size Requisition
--
-- | The size requisition of a widget is it's desired width and height. This
-- is represented by a 'Requisition'.
--
-- How a widget determines its desired size depends on the widget. A
-- 'Label', for example, requests enough space to display all its text.
-- Container widgets generally base their size request on the requisitions of
-- their children.
--
-- The size requisition phase of the widget layout process operates
-- top-down. It starts at a top-level widget, typically a 'Window'. The
-- top-level widget asks its child for its size requisition by calling
-- 'widgetSizeRequest'. To determine its requisition, the child asks its own
-- children for their requisitions and so on. Finally, the top-level widget
-- will get a requisition back from its child.

-- ** Size Allocation
--
-- | When the top-level widget has determined how much space its child would
-- like to have, the second phase of the size negotiation, size allocation,
-- begins. Depending on its configuration (see 'windowSetResizable'), the
-- top-level widget may be able to expand in order to satisfy the size request
-- or it may have to ignore the size request and keep its fixed size. It then
-- tells its child widget how much space it gets by calling
-- 'widgetSizeAllocate'. The child widget divides the space among its children
-- and tells each child how much space it got, and so on. Under normal
-- circumstances, a 'Window' will always give its child the amount of space the
-- child requested.
--
-- A child's size allocation is represented by an 'Allocation'.
-- This contains not only a width and height, but also a
-- position (i.e. X and Y coordinates), so that containers can tell their
-- children not only how much space they have gotten, but also where they are
-- positioned inside the space available to the container.
--
-- Widgets are required to honor the size allocation they receive; a size
-- request is only a request, and widgets must be able to cope with any size.

-- ** Child attributes
--
-- | 'Container' introduces child attributes - these are object attributes
-- that are not specific to either the container or the contained widget, but
-- rather to their relation. Typical examples of child attributes are the
-- position or pack-type of a widget which is contained in a 'Box'.
--
-- The 'Container' class does not itself define any child attributes, they are
-- defined (and documented) by the various 'Container' subclasses.
--
-- Child attributes can be set or obtained in a similar way to ordinary
-- attributes. So ordinary attributes are set like so:
--
-- > set object [ attr := value ]
--
-- Whereas child attributes take the child object as a parameter:
--
-- > set container [ attr child := value ]
--
-- And similarily for getting a child attribute's value:
--
-- > value <- get container (attr child)

-- Methods

-- | Adds @widget@ to the container. Typically used for simple containers such
-- as 'Window', 'Frame', or 'Button'; for more complicated layout containers
-- such as 'Box' or 'Table', this function will pick default packing parameters
-- that may not be correct. So consider functions such as 'boxPackStart' and
-- 'tableAttach' as an alternative to 'containerAdd' in those cases. A widget
-- may be added to only one container at a time; you can't place the same
-- widget inside two different containers.
--
containerAdd :: (ContainerClass self, WidgetClass widget) => self
 -> widget -- ^ @widget@ - a widget to be placed inside @container@
 -> IO ()
containerAdd self widget =
  {# call container_add #}

-- | Removes @widget@ from @container@. @widget@ must be inside @container@.
--

 -> widget -- ^ @widget@ - a current child of @container@
 -> IO ()
containerRemove self widget =
  {# call container_remove #}
    (toContainer self)
    (toWidget widget)

-- | Maps @callback@ over each non-internal child of @container@. See
-- 'containerForall' for details on what constitutes an \"internal\" child.
-- Most applications should use 'containerForeach', rather than
-- 'containerForall'.
--
containerForeach :: ContainerClass self => self

-- | Maps @callback@ over each child of @container@, including children that
-- are considered \"internal\" (implementation details of the container).
-- \"Internal\" children generally weren't added by the user of the container,
-- but were added by the container implementation itself. Most applications
-- should use 'containerForeach', rather than 'containerForall'.

-- | Sets a focus chain, overriding the one computed automatically by Gtk+.
--
-- In principle each widget in the chain should be a descendant of the
-- container, but this is not enforced by this method, since it's allowed to

-- chain that isn't always packed. The necessary checks are done when the focus

-- | This is initialized at program startup with the version of Qt that the

-- are made available in the API.
--
-- The Qt version determined the following method:
--
-- * If @QTAH_QT=x.y@ is in the environment, then this value will be used.
--
-- * Otherwise, if @QTAH_QT=x@ is in the environment, then we query @qmake
-- -qt=$QTAH_QT -version@ for the version of Qt to use.
--
-- * Otherwise, we query @qmake -version@ for the version of Qt to use.  Setting
-- @QT_SELECT@ in the environment can select a major version of Qt to use.
--
-- For more information on @qmake -qt@ and @QT_SELECT@, see @man qtchooser@.

install.sh - Qtah build script

Builds and installs Qtah for a specific version of Qt's API.  Performs an
incremental build, unless clean.sh is run first.  Some environment variables
control this script's operation:

  QTAH_BUILD_JOBS:
    This may be a positive integer, to control how many build jobs are run in
    parallel.  Passed as --jobs to cabal build.

  QTAH_QT_FLAGS:
    This value is passed as --flags to the qtah-cpp and qtah packages, and can
    be used to set the qtX flags (e.g. qt4, qt5) for Qt version selection.
    If unset, this variable defaults to qt5.  If it set to the empty string,
    then the system default Qt is used.  See README.md for more information.

  QTAH_QMAKE:
    This overrides the QMake executable used to build qtah-cpp.
